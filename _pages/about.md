I am an associate professor in the [Machine Learning Group](https://machine-learning.uit.no) at UiT The Arctic University of Norway and a principal investigator in the [SFI Visual Intelligence](https://www.visual-intelligence.no/) and the [SFF Integreat](https://www.integreat.no/). My main research area is deep learning, with a particular focus on explainability and learning with limited labels. I am also interested in uncertainty modeling, information theory, kernel methods, and medical image analysis.

I am co-chair for the winter school of the yearly [Northern Light Deep Learning conference](https://www.nldl.org) and a board member for the [Norwegian Association for Image Processing and Machine Learning](https://sites.google.com/view/nobim). In the past, I have been part of the steering committee for the [Visual Intelligence Gradudate School](https://www.visual-intelligence.no/about/vigs) and part of the student council for the [NORA Research School](https://www.nora.ai/).

I have previously been a guest researcher in the Image Processing Laboratory at the University of Valencia with Professor Gustau Camps-Valls, in the Understandable Machine Intelligence Laboratory at the Technical University of Berlin with Professor Marina M.-C. Höhne, and in the Section for Cognitive Systems at the Technical University of Denmark with Professor Lars Kai Hansen.
